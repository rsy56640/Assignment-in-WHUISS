/* This program illustrates a number of perhaps confusing features of
 * signal delivery.  It shows how signals can be blocked, how pending
 * signals are merged, how you can jump out of a signal handler into
 * another, how resetting signal handlers differ from non-resetting signal
 * handlers  and how to check whether or not pending signals are of a
 * certain type.
 *
 * You want to run this program a number of times to illustrate all of the
 * different features.  Hopefully the commentary in the code below will
 * help you remember all the things you want to demonstrate.
